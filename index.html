        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
        <p>I am currently learning web development via online courses and very 
          soon I'll begin a bootcamp. I'm excited to continue learning and 
          growing. In my former career, I was a teacher. I realized I was ready
          for something different, so I quit my job and did some soul searching.
          That led me to web development!</p>
          <p>I love solving problems, finding efficient
          processes, designing the details, and learning new concepts. I also love
          the growing field, flexible schedules, and remote job opportunities. 
          Keep reading for more details about my background.</p>
